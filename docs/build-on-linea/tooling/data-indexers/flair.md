# üîÆ Flair

üëã <b>Welcome to [Flair](https://flair.dev)</b><br />
Real-time and historical custom data indexing for any evm chain.

Flair offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

## Why Flair?

Compared to other alternatives the main reasons are:

* üöÄ  Adopting **parallel and distributed processing** paradigm means high scalability and resiliency for your indexing stack. Instead of constrained sequential processing (e.g Subgraph).
* üß©  Focused on **primitives**, which means on the left you plug-in an RPC and on the right you output the data to any destination database.
* üöÑ  Native **real-time stream processing** for certain data workload (such as aggregations, rollups) for things like total volume per pool, or total portfolio per user wallet.
* ‚òÅÔ∏è  **Managed** cloud services avoid DevOps and irrelevant engineering costs for dApp developers.
* üßë‚Äçüíª  Avoid decentralization **overhead** (consensus, network hops, etc) since we believe to enable best UX for dApps reading data must be as close to the developers as possible.
### Features

* ‚úÖ Listen to **any EVM chain** with just an RPC URL.
  * Free managed RPC URLs for +8 popular chains already included.
  * Works with both websocket and https-only RPCs.
* ‚úÖ Track and ingest **any contract** for **any event topic.**
  * Auto-track new contracts deployed from factory contracts.
* ‚úÖ **Custom processor scripts** with Javascript runtime (with **Typescript** support)
  * Make external API or Webhook calls to third-party or your backend.
  * Get current or historical USD value of any ERC20 token amount of any contract address on any chain.
  * Use any external NPM library.
* ‚úÖ **Stream** any stored data to your destination database (Postgres, MognoDB, MySQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Timescale, etc).

## Getting Started

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate.git
# ... follow instructions in README.md
```
::: info
Boilerplate instructions will create a **new cluster**, generate **an API Key**, and set up a manifest.yml to index your **first contract** with **sample custom processor** scripts.

Learn more about the [structure of manifest.yml](https://docs.flair.build/reference/manifest.yml).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Linea RPC nodes

Set a unique namespace, Linea chainId and RPC endpoint in your `config`. Remember that you can add up to 10 RPC endpoints for resiliency.

```yaml
{
  "cluster": "dev",
  "namespace": "my-awesome-linea-indexing-dev",
  "indexers": [
    {
      "chainId": 59140,
      "enabled": true,
      "ingestionFilterGroup": "default",
      "processingFilterGroup": "default",
      "sources": [
        # Highly-recommended to have at least 1 websocket endpoint
        "wss://linea-mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxx",
        "https://linea-mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxx",
        # You can put multiple endpoints for failover
        "https://rpc.linea.build"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ [Query](https://docs.flair.build/#getting-started) your custom indexed data.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Stream the data to your [own database](https://docs.flair.build/reference/database).
